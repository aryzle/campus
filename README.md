## Contributing
Follow this guide loosely for now until I write this up for our specific case
https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests

Basically on your own fork you will:

1.  create new branch
2.  do work
3.  commit work
4.  push it to origin which is your fork still
5.  make a Pull Request (PR) to this repo from your repo on github
6.  I will review the change and either add it or comment what needs to be fixed
